# Dual-Degree-Project
The project is being undertaken under **Prof. Sriramkumar L** in the **Physics Department** as a compulsory requirement for MTech in Data Science.

# Project Title
Constraining the cosmological parameters from the Type-IA Supernovae data

# Project Description
The project involves the fitting of the luminosity-distance data as a function of redshifts of the supernovae and subsequently fitting it in the generic form of Friedmann Equations of cosmology to obtain the cosmological parameters ($\Omega_r$, $\Omega_m$, $\Omega_l$ and $\Omega_k$)according to the different available models.

**1. $\lambda$-CDM Model**
The model assumes the universe to be flat and therefore making $\Omega_k = 0$
